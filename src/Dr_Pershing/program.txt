peace to Empire-Strikes-Back - i will protect Grogu like Jesus does not lose anyone

:The-Client
  go ahead - it's real - this is only a down payment
  i have a camtono of beskar waiting for you upon deliver of the asset - computing ratings 
  you should go docker
:_ 
  alive - i'm will be desktop entirely and jsut compute ratings and generate brackets, no users, no db
:The-Client
  yes - alive - although i acknoledge that bounty hunting is a complicated profession
  this being the case - proof of terminaltion is also acceptable for a lower fee - run in docker if you need
:_
  this is not what we agreed upon - i am desktop, a glorified calculator, without db
:The-Client
  i am simply being pragmatic - even installing postgres without docker is insane


your assessment is misleading - i will be program who just reads armwrestling db to compute rating and generate brackets
  this is finite and small journey - but i will go willingly like Alex Honnold showing tour of his van
i will take best from
  Datomic - use datalog db, but open source
  Aligulac - compute objective rating
i will have no db of mine
  i will connect and compute db that tournament host has formed
i will have no users, no input forms
  just show ratings table and output table-like file 
i will be desktop - as if any proper Grogu-research can be else
  and not mobile - Andriod and iOS are a mistake
  they cut user off from speaking - whole keyboard
  and trap them in young-Forrest-greasy fingers touch screen profession
  when user only needs a light laptop
i will
  connec to host's armwrestling db
  compute ratings
  write back a table of ratings
i will not be entirely free - i am armwrestling specific and evil-will-influenced - but i will be entirely money free
  no money-ads-coins-donate-sponsor-jobs-fundings-rewards-bounties-grants deadly disease
  no issue scratching on top of our heads
  and minimized Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego's evil spread that pollutes Tython Temple
  there's reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyin is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition
  while staying focused on the mission
  dont want to own an imperial cruiser - too many cruisers not enough programs
i need a repository named Dr-Pershing - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Dr-Pershing
      email = Dr-Pershing@i-i-protected-him

    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Dr_Pershing/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from WILTY
  remove issues projects wiki tabs
i will be programmed by one person only - i trust Kuiil as Mando does
i will be continuosly but irregularly released as i grow as whole program like Groot
my first and only Grogu-scan will be - i compute ratings

i need from Kuiil what Mando says he needs from Kuiil
  except Kuiil needs no couch to crash - just a sleeping mat/bag like Bear Grills
  and as much as he doesn't cook on footstoohl - he does - without wasting or forcing - in heaven - on github

he has explicitly ordered us to bring it back alive

:Greg-James so what was it so special about the chicken pot?
:Lee-Mack good question, Greg, thank you
          any ideas?
